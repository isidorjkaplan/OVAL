This was a basic model which had several layers of depth
and contained no LSTM or transfer learning. 

After around 10 hours of offline training its videos were 
almost indistinguishable from the originals. Very good. 

Its compression was only around 10x though. 
This could likely be improved even further 
once we incorperate memory elements into it.
